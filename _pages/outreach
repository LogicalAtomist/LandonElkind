Where I have worked during my academic career, I also worked to promote philosophy in local high schools. 
I first got involved in such outreach when Kris Phillips and Greg Stoutenburg invited me to help with 
their Iowa Lyceum at the University of Iowa.

Since then I have founded a version of the Iowa Lyceum in Kentucky, named the Hilltopper Philosophy Academy 
(after Western Kentucky University's demonym, the Hilltoppers). 
[Check out the PhilToppers here](https://orgs.wku.edu/philtoppers/)!

Academy, [you can contact us here](mailto:landon.elkind@wku.edu).
