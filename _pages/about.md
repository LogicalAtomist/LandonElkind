Welcome to my website! I am Western Kentucky University's resident logical atomist, and an [Assistant Professor of Philosophy](https://www.wku.edu/philosophy-religion/) in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.wku.edu/political-science/). Here is [a link to my CV](https://ln4.sync.com/dl/de4dc01c0/ikzwbf4p-x68zj744-j8n2x49p-dn3ux3de). Most of my current research focuses on the [*Principia* Rewrite project](https://www.principiarewrite.com/), which you can learn more about on my research page.

In true Texan fashion, I started in philosophy while in a car, reading Platoâ€™s Republic on a road trip to Houston in junior high. I later took symbolic logic as a college freshman and fell in love with the subject. One thing led to another, and in 2018, I got a PhD in Philosophy and an MS in Mathematics from the [University of Iowa](https://clas.uiowa.edu/philosophy/).
