<h1>About this calculator</h1>
In a five-minute exercise with Googling, you can calculate how much tuition profit 
is generated by your teaching! Anyone in a workplace should have a back-of-a-napkin 
calculation of how much their labor is worth to their employer, for all sorts of 
purposes - negotiating, informal conversations and education, and so on. 
And now you can, too!

The point of calculating this number is not to make a statement about what the value 
of education 'really' is or to say that teaching is measured in dollars. Rather, it 
is empowering to know what the exchange value (in market terms) of our work.

It is also true that almost nobody who teaches in a modern university setting - where 
tons of crucial work is done by non-instructional staff - wants to keep *all* the tuition 
revenue they generate. Most instructors want someone else to handle building management, 
procurement, and the millions of day-to-day tasks done by many other people. But it is 
good for instructors who are making unfair (<i>i.e.</i> unlivable) wages to know just what 
their labor is worth, and how much of that worth is being sent elsewhere.

You will need to find a bit of information to use this calculator, but most universtiy 
registrars post tuition rates publicly, and many universities also have statistics on 
students enrolled, and how many pay resident tuition rates versus non-resident tuition 
rates (if applicable). Comments and criticisms are welcome.
