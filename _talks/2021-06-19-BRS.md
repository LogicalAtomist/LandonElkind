  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  There have been multiple reconstructions of the propositional logic of 
  *Principia* beginning with the artificial intelligence research of 
  Newell, Simon, and Shaw in the 1950s, including the mechanical validity-checker 
  of Hao Wang (see ''IBM Journal of Research and Development'' 1960), and 
  the proof reconstructions of Daniel O'Leary using Polish notations (see *Russell* 
  1988). To these results I have added a fully computer-checked reconstruction of 
  the propositional logic of "Principia" following the proof sketches 
  indicated in that work. This talk will discuss what computer-checking *Principia* 
  proofs in `Coq` tells us about the proof sketches, and also about the development 
  of propositional logic between *Principia* and Russell's 1906 ''The Theory of Implication.''
