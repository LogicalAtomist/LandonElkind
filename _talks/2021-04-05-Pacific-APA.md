  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There has recently been much-needed critical discussion of the current Anglo-American philosophical canons, 
but not as much consideration of their nature and purposes. I discuss what philosophical canons are and 
argue that they are social practices, and in particular, social practices of enforcing rules. I then 
consider what purposes a philosophical canon can have for various stakeholders. Building on Luca Castagnoliâ€™s 
work on self-refutation in ancient philosophy, I clarify various notions of being practically self-undermining. 
I then argue that even on an inclusive view of what the purposes of a philosophical canon are, any philosophical 
canon is self-undermining. There is no plausible account of the purposes of a philosophical canon that is not 
undermined by having one, whatever its makeup.
