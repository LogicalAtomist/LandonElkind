title: "Conceptual Engineering or Revisionary Conceptual Analysis? The Case of Russell's Metaphilosophy Based on *Principia Mathematica*'s Logic"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CEorRCA
excerpt: 'Conceptual engineers have made hay over the differences of their metaphilosophy from those of conceptual analysts. In this article, I argue that the differences are not as great as conceptual engineers have, perhaps rhetorically, made them seem. That is, conceptual analysts asking 'What is *X*?' questions can do much the same work that conceptual engineers can do with 'What is *X* for?' questions, at least if conceptual analysts self-understand their activity as a revisionary enterprise. I show this with a study of Russell's metaphilosophy, which was just such a revisionary conception of conceptual analysis.'

Conceptual engineers have made hay over the differences of their metaphilosophy from those of conceptual analysts. In this article, I argue that the differences are not as great as conceptual engineers have, perhaps rhetorically, made them seem. That is, conceptual analysts asking 'What is *X*?' questions can do much the same work that conceptual engineers can do with 'What is *X* for?' questions, at least if conceptual analysts self-understand their activity as a revisionary enterprise. I show this with a study of Russell's metaphilosophy, which was just such a revisionary conception of conceptual analysis.
